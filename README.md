# Performance Passport

Performance Passport is a personal running intelligence and coaching platform
built with Python, Streamlit and SQLite.

It goes beyond recording what happened by explaining what a run means compared
with the athlete's own genuinely similar historical sessions.

## Vision

Create the ultimate coaching dashboard that answers questions such as:

- Am I getting fitter?
- How much did the weather affect today's run?
- Was this session better than last month's?
- What pace should I run next week?
- Am I ready for a PB?
